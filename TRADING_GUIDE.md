# 📈 Trading Guide - How to Use Your Alert System

## 🎯 Action Levels & Strategy

### 🚀 STRONG BUY (80%+ Score)
**Strategy**: Buy immediately at current price
- **Why**: 4-5 technical indicators are bullish
- **Risk**: Missing the move if you wait for pullbacks
- **Position**: Buy 60-70% now, keep 30-40% for dips
- **Entry Points**: Bonus opportunities if stock pulls back

**Example**: AVGO at $309.09 with 80% score
- ✅ **Buy now**: $309.09
- 🎯 **Add more if it hits**: $295.14 or $288.01
- 🛑 **Stop loss**: $284.36 (-8%)
- 🎯 **Take profit**: $355.45 (+15%)

### ⚡ GOOD SETUP (60-79% Score)
**Strategy**: Wait for entry points or buy small position
- **Why**: 3-4 indicators are positive, but not all aligned
- **Risk**: Moderate - could go either way
- **Position**: Buy 30-50% now, wait for entry points for the rest
- **Entry Points**: Primary buying opportunities

**Example**: AMD at $184.42 with 60% score
- ⏳ **Wait for**: $169.30 (first entry) or $158.62 (second entry)
- 💡 **Or buy small**: 30% position now, 70% at entry points
- 🛑 **Stop loss**: $169.67 (-8%)
- 🎯 **Take profit**: $212.08 (+15%)

### ⏳ WAIT (40-59% Score)
**Strategy**: Wait for entry points only
- **Why**: Only 2-3 indicators are positive
- **Risk**: High chance of further decline
- **Position**: Don't buy at current price
- **Entry Points**: Only buying opportunities

**Example**: TSLA at $339.38 with 40% score
- ❌ **Don't buy now**: Too risky at current price
- ⏳ **Wait for**: $325.33 or $322.47
- 🛑 **Stop loss**: $299.23 (-8% from entry)
- 🎯 **Take profit**: $374.13 (+15% from entry)

### 🛑 AVOID (0-39% Score)
**Strategy**: Stay away completely
- **Why**: Most indicators are negative
- **Risk**: Very high chance of losses
- **Position**: No position, wait for better setup
- **Entry Points**: Even entry points are risky

## 📊 Position Sizing Rules

### Take Profit Rules:

## 📱 Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (9:00 AM):
1. **Check macOS notification** for top opportunities
2. **Review detailed analysis** in terminal or logs
3. **Identify action items**:
   - Strong Buys → Buy immediately
   - Good Setups → Set alerts at entry points
   - Waits → Set alerts at entry points only
   - Avoids → Ignore completely

### Throughout the Day:
1. **Set price alerts** at entry points for Good Setups and Waits
2. **Monitor Strong Buys** for any major changes
3. **Execute trades** when alerts trigger

### Evening Review:
1. **Check positions** against stop losses
2. **Review any trades** made during the day
3. **Prepare for next day** based on overnight news

## 🎯 Entry Point Strategy

### Understanding Entry Points:
- **Entry 1**: Closest to current price (highest probability)
- **Entry 2**: Further from current price (better discount)
- **Both are support levels** where stock is likely to bounce

### How to Use Entry Points:
1. **Set price alerts** at both entry levels
2. **Buy 50% at Entry 1** if it hits
3. **Buy remaining 50% at Entry 2** if it hits
4. **If only Entry 1 hits**, that's your full position
5. **If neither hits**, wait for next day's analysis
