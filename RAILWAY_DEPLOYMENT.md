- Make it **Public** (required for Railway free tier)
- Don't initialize with README (you already have files)

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO with your actual GitHub details
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
